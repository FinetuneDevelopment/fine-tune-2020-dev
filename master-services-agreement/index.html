              <ol>
                <li>As a <q>master</q> form of contract, this Agreement allows the parties to contract for multiple Projects through the issuance of multiple Work Statements, without having to re-negotiate the basic terms and conditions contained herein. This Agreement covers the provision of services by Finetune and Finetune's Affiliates and, accordingly, this Agreement represents a vehicle by which the Client can efficiently contract with Finetune and its Affiliates for a range of services.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Work Statements.</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>The specific details of each Project shall be separately negotiated and specified in a Work Statement. Each Work Statement will include, as appropriate, the scope of work, Work Programme, and Budget and payment schedule. Each Work Statement shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in addition to the specific details set forth in the Work Statement.</li>
                <li>To the extent any terms or provisions of a Work Statement conflict with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall prevail unless any Work Statement specifically states an intent to supersede the terms of this Agreement on a specific matter. All Work Statements shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference.
                </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Nature of Services.</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>The specific Services will be specified in relation to any Project in the relevant Work Statement.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Payment of Fees and Expenses.</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>The Client will pay Finetune for fees, expenses and Pass-through Costs in accordance with the Budget and payment schedule contained in each Work Statement. The Client agrees that the Budget and payment schedule for each Work Statement will be structured in an effort to maintain cash neutrality for Finetune (with respect to the payment of professional fees, Pass-through Costs and otherwise).</li>
                <li>The Client agrees that a prepayment may be necessary for Finetune to maintain cash neutrality over the term of the Work Statement taking into account payment terms agreed upon between the parties. Unless otherwise agreed in a particular Work Statement, the following shall apply:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Finetune will invoice the Client on completion of the relevant Work Statement for the fees, expenses and Pass-through Costs incurred in performing the Services; and,</li>
                    <li>The Client shall pay each invoice within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. If any portion of an invoice is disputed, then the Client shall pay the undisputed amounts as set forth in the preceding sentence and the parties shall use good faith efforts to reconcile the disputed amount as soon as practicable. the Client shall pay Finetune interest in an amount equal to one percent (1%) per month of all undisputed amounts owing hereunder and not paid within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Scope of Services</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Finetune shall author, design, create, develop, test and produce the Deliverables, in accordance with the Work Statement. At any time during the term of this Agreement, the Client may request additional services to be performed by Finetune. Such additional work shall be agreed upon in writing by the parties and shall be recorded in a Work Statement which Work Statement shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and become effective upon execution, by authorised representatives of both parties.</li>
                <li>Finetune agrees to use all reasonable endeavours to complete the Deliverables in a timely manner according to the relevant Work Programme but the obligations with respect to meeting each Work Programme are subject to delays caused by Force Majeure. Finetune agrees to notify the Client promptly of any event coming to its attention that may affect Finetune's ability to meet the requirements of a Work Statement, or that is likely to cause any material delay in delivery of the Deliverables. Finetune shall not be in breach of this Agreement as a result of a reasonable delay in delivering the Deliverables caused by Force Majeure.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Change Orders.</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>If the Client wishes to amend the scope of a Work Statement, the parties will use all reasonable endeavours to agree a Change Order. Each Change Order shall detail the requested changes to the applicable task, responsibility, duty, Budget, Work Programme or other matter. The Change Order will become effective upon the execution of the Change Order by both parties and will include a specified period of time (as agreed upon by the parties) within which Finetune will implement the changes and any increase in price.</li>
                <li>Both parties agree to act in good faith and promptly when considering a Change Order requested by the other party. Finetune reserves the right to postpone effecting material changes in the Project's scope until such time as the parties agree to and execute the corresponding Change Order.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Compensation</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>If Finetune quotes an unqualified and unconditioned price for Deliverables or particular services in the Work Statement, the amount quoted shall be deemed a fixed price. Unless the Work Statement provides for progress payments, deferral of payment after completion or some other form of payment schedule, the Client shall pay the full amount of the fixed price associated with the Deliverables and shall begin making payments for Finetune&apos;s hosting services upon delivery of final Deliverables.</li>
                <li>Except as set forth in the Work Statement, Finetune shall bear all of its own expenses arising from its performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (without limitation) expenses for facilities, work spaces, utilities, management, clerical and reproduction services, supplies, and the like.</li>
                <li>With respect to Deliverables, and other services for which the parties determine that payment on a fixed price basis is not appropriate, the Work Statement may provide for payment on the basis of time and materials, determined according to the hourly rates set for Finetune's employees by skill level in the schedule of rates forming Part 2 of the Schedule. The parties may agree on a maximum aggregate amount for a particular Project. Finetune shall use all reasonable endeavours to complete the specified Services and/or Deliverables for no more than such aggregate amount. Should Finetune determine at any time that it may be necessary to exceed such aggregate amount, Finetune shall provide a written notice to the Client, indicating the estimated cost to complete the Project. Following receipt of such estimate, the Client shall immediately instruct Finetune in writing to (i) halt work with respect to such Project, (ii) continue on a time and material basis, or (iii) suspend work pending further negotiation of a fixed price for completion.</li>
                <li>The hourly rates prescribed by the schedule of rates, shall be in lieu of compensation or reimbursement for any costs or burden incurred by Finetune except as specifically set out in the Work Statement. Rates quoted by Finetune in the schedule of rates are subject to change upon sixty (90) days' advance notice, provided that any such change shall have no effect upon rates or charges for work already rendered or scheduled to be rendered within thirty (30) days of the issue of such notice.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2 class="h3">Term and Termination</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>This Agreement shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall continue for the Relevant Period, or until terminated by either party in accordance with Clause 9.2 or 9.3 below.</li>
                <li>After the Relevant Period, the Agreement will automatically renew each year thereafter for a period of one year, unless either party notifies the other party in writing at least 30 days prior to the renewal date that it does not want to renew the Agreement.</li>
                <li>Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party if:
